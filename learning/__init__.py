This is the top level __init__ (or initialization) file.
Nothing really happens here, but you need the __init__.py file to be present.
Most people use this to introduce their package ('learning' in this case)
and any subpackages. Here, we just have one file, no subpackages.

At the bottom, I have included the __version__ variable. This information is 
used by the setup.py file at the root of the repository.
